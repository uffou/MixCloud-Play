## 0.19.0 - ðŸŽƒ Less Surprises Release

### Changed

A **big** re-write of how track info is collected and track changes are checked which allows the Menu Tray and Notifications to better stay in sync - _so you can see what you hear_ -  less surprises! ðŸŽƒ

But one _surprising_ change ðŸ§™ is that now when you attempt to quit or close the window while the audio is playing... the app will close! Why is that a suprise? Well in the past it didn't do this [mountainash/Mixcloud-Play#89](https://github.com/mountainash/Mixcloud-Play/issues/89)

## 0.18.0 - You [un]blocked me on Facebook

### Changed

While updating the code to change from using an Electron deprecated window handling method, we were also able to make an allowance for facebook.com for anyone wanting to login to Mixcloud using their Facebook login (closes #59)

### Dependency Updates

-Update from Electron 12 to Electron 13

## 0.16.0 - Remember me?

### Changed

From this release your login details will be captured and stored in your device Keystore (Keychain) so when your session expires and you see the Mixcloud homepage, just click the "Login" link and you stored details will be submitted and boom, you're ready to listen to beats with a click (no keyboard required).

If you want to clear your login (or switch to another account) use the "Logout" menu item from the Mixcloud Play menu.

This release also includes a **massive** Electron version bump (Electron v4.2.12 -> v12.0.2) so probably expect some performance & security benefits (the usual things with new dependencies).

## 0.13.0 - Copy & Paste, Release

### Changed

The "copy & paste" Release allows you to do just that, you can now copy & paste your comment or a search term using the right-click context menu (you could before only if you knew the famous universal keyboard short-cuts).

But that's not all:
- you can also correct spelling mistakes (just by right clicking on them and picking a suggestion)
